# 🔐 TrustBuddy — Verify Before You Trust

**TrustBuddy** is an open-source web platform that helps users **verify the trustworthiness** of websites, sellers, and services before engaging with them. It empowers people to avoid online scams through community-reported data and transparent trust scoring.

> 🛡️ “In a world full of scams, trust needs a watchdog.”

## 💡 Why TrustBuddy?

Scams are rising, and there's no universal platform where users can:
- Check if a website or seller is trustworthy
- Read reports from real users
- Report scams with evidence
- Share warnings to protect others

**TrustBuddy fills this gap.**  
We aim to make the internet safer by crowdsourcing transparency.
